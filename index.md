## [Compressible Aerodynamics Calculator](/compressible-calculator)

Solve isentropic flow, normal shock, oblique shock, Fanno flow, and Rayleigh flow relations quickly and easily.
See sample implementations in Python, JavaScript, MATLAB, and C++.
This calculator is based on Virginia Tech's [Compressible Aerodynamics Calculator](http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3114/calc.html).
